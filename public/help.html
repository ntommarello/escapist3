	<p>Custom domains let you host your events with a URL like "www.mywebsite.com".</p>

	<p>First, you'll need to buy a domain from a registrar like GoDaddy, pairNIC, Register, or iWantMyName. This usually costs $10-$40 per year. Then you'll need to follow the registrar's instructions to point the domain's A-record (IP address) to <b>50.19.236.102</b>
	<p>Please note that you need to change your domain's or sub-domain's A Record, not its nameservers. And, you don't need to forward or redirect anything, you only need to change the A Record.</p>
	<p>Once you've done this, you may need to wait up to 72 hours for the change to take effect. If the domain is set up properly, you should see the Escapist home page when you visit your domain. </p>

	<p>In order to use the Facebook Connect on your custom domain, you'll need to create a Facebook application on the Facebook site. The application will allow your site and Facebook to connect to each other.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Login to Facebook with your usual Facebook account. Then register your site as an application on Facebook at <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/">http://developers.facebook.com/</a>.</li>
		<li>You'll then need to name your application and accept the Terms of Use.</li>
		<li>Go to the Website tab for the Facebook app settings.</li>
	<li>In the Site URL field, type in the URL to your site domain (ex: http://www.yoursite.com).</li>
	<li>In the Site Domain field, type in your site domain (ex: yoursite.com).</li>
	<li>Take note of the Application ID and Application Secret code that Facebook has generated for you, as they need to be entered into your Settings.</li>
	<li>The rest of the fields are not important to the FBC module, but you can fill out some of them if you wish.</li>
	</ul>
