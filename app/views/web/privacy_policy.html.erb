	<span class="HighlightedTitle"><%=APP_NAME.upcase%> PRIVACY POLICY</span>

	<p><%=APP_NAME%>, Inc. ("<%=APP_NAME%>") values the privacy of our customers (collectively or individually, "Users") who use the mobile applications, <%=APP_NAME%>.io Web site, and other web sites, online services, or content (e.g., widgets, feeds, and applications) owned or operated by <%=APP_NAME%> (collectively, the "<%=APP_NAME%> Services").</p>

	<p>This Privacy Notice governs the <%=APP_NAME%> Services, and details important information about the use and disclosure of User information collected through the <%=APP_NAME%> Services. <%=APP_NAME%> provides this Privacy Notice to help you make an informed decision about whether to use the <%=APP_NAME%> Services.</p>

	<p>This Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the <%=APP_NAME%> Terms of Use. Your use of the <%=APP_NAME%> Services and any personal information you provide on the <%=APP_NAME%> Services remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Notice and the Terms of Use.</p>

	<p class="HighlightedTitle">IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES AND CONSENTS:</p>

	<p><%=APP_NAME%> collects, maintains, uses, and displays your personal data and the geographic location of your mobile device (we call this location fix of your device "location information" or "geo-location") to provide the <%=APP_NAME%> Services.</p>

	<p>By using the <%=APP_NAME%> Services, you have consented to: (1) the use of your device's location to provide <%=APP_NAME%>'s services including relevant advertisements, and the display of that location information to your <%=APP_NAME%> friends and within your geo-tagged messages and content; and (2) pay carrier data, messaging, and other fees resulting from <%=APP_NAME%> usage.</p>

	<p>The <%=APP_NAME%> Services default privacy settings are set for the way that most Users use the services: we save your password for the mobile applications, your mobile device's geo-location is updated automatically, and that location information may be displayed to your <%=APP_NAME%> friends even when <%=APP_NAME%> is not open and running on your device. Changing these settings is easy - just select 'Settings' on the <%=APP_NAME%> mobile application or manage your preferences via the <%=APP_NAME%>.io Web site.</p>

	<p>Please note that any personal information you voluntarily disclose online becomes publicly available and can be read, collected, and used by others and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. <%=APP_NAME%> is not responsible for the information that you choose to disclose publicly on or through the <%=APP_NAME%> Services.</p>


	<p class="HighlightedTitle">THE INFORMATION <%=APP_NAME.upcase%> COLLECTS:</p>

	<p>"PROFILE INFORMATION": When using the <%=APP_NAME%> Services you provide certain other personal information and content - such as interests and hobbies, age, gender, sexual orientation, relationship status, and favorite activities and adventures, etc. - that will be publicly displayed to other Users and on third-party sites and services (for example, when using the <%=APP_NAME%> Services to publish updates to Twitter, Facebook, etc.) in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>

	<p>"LOCATION INFORMATION": To provide the <%=APP_NAME%> Services, we derive location information from your wireless carrier, certain third-party service providers, or directly from the mobile device that you used to register. This location tracking of your mobile device may occur even when the <%=APP_NAME%> mobile applications are not actively open and running in the foreground, but your location is displayed and shared with others only in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>

	<p>"COOKIES, PERSISTENT FILE INFORMATION": When you use the <%=APP_NAME%> Services, we may send one or more cookies (small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters) to your computer. <%=APP_NAME%> may use both session cookies and persistent cookies.

A persistent cookie remains after you close your web browser and may be used by us during your subsequent visits to the <%=APP_NAME%> Web site.

Your friend may contact <%=APP_NAME%> at <a href="mailto:privacy@<%=APP_URL %>">privacy@<%=APP_URL %></a> to request that <%=APP_NAME%> remove this information from our systems.</p>

	<p class="HighlightedTitle">THE WAY <%=APP_NAME.upcase%> USES INFORMATION:</p>

	<p><%=APP_NAME%> uses your personally identifiable, registration, profile, and location information to operate, maintain, and provide to you and other Users all of the features and functionality of the <%=APP_NAME%> Services.</p>

	<p>To provide the basic functionality of the <%=APP_NAME%> Services - such as showing the closest adventures - <%=APP_NAME%> maintains for its use only each User's most recent location fix. If Users choose to "geo-tag" certain content or data with location information, then <%=APP_NAME%> maintains these geo-tags for so long as the applicable content remains on <%=APP_NAME%>'s systems.</p>

	<p><%=APP_NAME%> uses your personally identifiable, location, and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous log file information) to track and analyze User preferences and trends in order to improve the quality and design of the <%=APP_NAME%> Services and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services.</p>

	<p><%=APP_NAME%> uses cookies and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the <%=APP_NAME%> Services; (b) provide custom and personalized content, advertisements, and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; and (d) monitor aggregate usage metrics.</p>

	<p><%=APP_NAME%> uses your email address from time-to-time to send you messages from <%=APP_NAME%> such as privacy or security related notices, notifying you of major <%=APP_NAME%> Services updates, or for other customer service purposes.</p>

	<p><%=APP_NAME%> uses your personally identifiable, registration, profile, and location information to serve and personalize in-service advertisements specifically tailored to you and your interests. For example, if you put a favorite band in your profile, then we might serve you an advertisement highlighting the concert of a similar band playing nearby in your city. However, we do not disclose who you are to the music company or advertiser.</p>

	<p class="HighlightedTitle">WHEN <%=APP_NAME.upcase%> DISCLOSES INFORMATION:</p>

	<p><%=APP_NAME%> discloses some personally identifiable, registration, profile, or location information to subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons to: (a) provide certain features; (b) serve relevant advertisements in support of the <%=APP_NAME%> Services; and (c) process such information on our behalf. For example, we may disclose information to wireless carrier partners for the purpose of revenue recognition, or we may disclose certain information in order to provide mapping, points-of-interest, local content, or navigation features. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Notice and use appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information.</p>

	<p><%=APP_NAME%> discloses aggregate, anonymous log file and usage information in reports to interested third parties to assist those parties in understanding the usage patterns and perfomance results of certain advertisements, content, services, promotions, or features. For example, we may provide aggregate-level reports to an advertising partner for the purpose of showing delivery and performance statistics of a specific advertising campaign.</p>

	<p><%=APP_NAME%> may release personally identifiable, registration, profile, or location information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.</p>

	<p><%=APP_NAME%> also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable, registration, profile, or location information that <%=APP_NAME%> believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to: enforce our Terms of Use; take precautions against liability; protect Users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; assist government enforcement agencies; protect the security or integrity of the <%=APP_NAME%> Services; or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of <%=APP_NAME%>, Users, or others.</p>

	<p><%=APP_NAME%> does not disclose your personally identifiable information or location information connected to your personally identifiable information to other companies for their commercial use without your express consent.</p>

	<p class="HighlightedTitle">YOUR CHOICES:</p>

	<p>You may update, correct, or delete your privacy settings and profile information at any time. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.</p>

	<p class="HighlightedTitle">OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY:</p>

	<p><%=APP_NAME%> uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards.

We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>

	<p>If <%=APP_NAME%> learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. <%=APP_NAME%> may post a notice on the <%=APP_NAME%> Services if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.</p>

	<p class="HighlightedTitle">OUR COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN'S PRIVACY:</p>

	<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, <%=APP_NAME%> does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information on the <%=APP_NAME%> Services from persons under 14 years-of-age, and no part of <%=APP_NAME%> Services is directed to persons under 14. IF YOU ARE UNDER 14 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE <%=APP_NAME%> SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER. If <%=APP_NAME%> learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 14-years-of-age has been collected on the <%=APP_NAME%> Services without verifiable parental consent, then <%=APP_NAME%> will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 14 has obtained a <%=APP_NAME%> Services account, then you may alert <%=APP_NAME%> at <a href="mailto:privacy@<%=APP_URL %>">privacy@<%=APP_URL %></a> and request that <%=APP_NAME%> delete that child's personal information from our systems.</p>

	<p class="HighlightedTitle">THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISERS AND AD-SERVING COMPANIES:</p>

	<p>Advertisements that appear on the <%=APP_NAME%> Services are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to Users by third-party advertisers or ad network companies. These companies may automatically receive your IP address or other information about your mobile device or personal computer when serving advertisements. These third parties may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of the advertisements served and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertiser or ad network to recognize your computer or mobile device each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of the ad and to personalize advertising content. These companies may compile information about the sites or services visited when seeing advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. <%=APP_NAME%> does not access or have control of the cookies that may be placed by third-party advertisers or ad networks. Likewise, third party advertisers and ad networks do not have access to your personal information stored with <%=APP_NAME%> unless you choose to share it with them.

	<p>In the event that <%=APP_NAME%> is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control so that the <%=APP_NAME%> Services can continue operations. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</p>
